"""Validate a Testimony Record and report the conformance level it reaches.

    python3 scripts/testimony_validate.py record.jsonl --json

The specification: https://infrastructure.omem-cloud.com/spec/testimony-record/

This is the reference validator, and it is deliberately boring: standard
library only, one file, no network. Copy it into your own repository and run it
in your own CI if that is easier than depending on ours. A conformance claim
that cannot be checked by the person hearing it is just an adjective.

What it checks is what a JSON Schema cannot: the relationships between entries.
A schema can say a belief has an evidence field. Only a validator can say the
evidence it cites exists, that both sides of a contradiction are still in the
record, that the risk class did not come from the model proposing the action,
and that the approver was a person the auth layer named.

# `scope` exists because this validator was refusing a level to systems that
# had earned it. TR-3 required at least one decision entry, on the reasoning
# that a record with no decisions cannot demonstrate a gate. True, and it meant
# a system which takes no actions at all could never pass TR-3, and since the
# ladder is cumulative its integrity at TR-4 stayed invisible however good it
# was. A record-only system with a real hash chain reported TR-2.
#
# Reported by Phill Clapham on 4 September 2026, who is that case: a chained
# audit, no actuation gate, and no need for one. The check it failed appears
# nowhere in the specification text, which says only that every consequential
# action produces a decision entry, and a system with no consequential actions
# satisfies that by having none.
#
# The check is still worth having, because without it a system that does act
# passes TR-3 by omitting its decisions. So the record declares whether the
# system acts, and the validator believes it. That declaration is visible in
# the reported level for the same reason the census reports what a subject
# claims: "TR-4, record only" is a different sentence from "TR-4".
#
# 0.1 records have no scope entry and are validated exactly as before.
