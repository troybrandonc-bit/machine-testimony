"""Put the reference validator in the wheel at build time.

The point of this package is that a LangGraph user can go from nothing to a
checked record without cloning anything. Emitting a record they cannot then
validate would leave them holding a file and a claim, which is the situation
the specification exists to end.

So `pip install testimony-langgraph` ships `testimony-validate` as well. The
validator is one standard-library file with no network access, and it is the
same file the repository uses, copied at build time rather than committed
twice. A second copy is a second copy to drift, and a validator that disagrees
with itself is worse than no validator.

When the source tree is absent and the copy is already here, that is the sdist
case: a wheel built from an sdist has no ../../scripts to read, and the file it
carries is the right one.
