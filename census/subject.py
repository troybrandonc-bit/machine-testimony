"""Subject files: one assessed system, and the rules that keep an assessment honest.

A census of other people's software is a document that can do real damage if it
is careless, and the people it damages did not ask to be in it. So the format
refuses more than it accepts:

  - Every applicable requirement must be assessed. A quietly omitted requirement
    is how an unflattering finding disappears.
  - Every verdict must cite evidence, INCLUDING `absent`. Saying a capability is
    missing without saying where you looked is not a measurement, it is an
    accusation, and it is the failure mode this whole census is most likely to
    commit.
  - `not_applicable` is only available for capabilities the subject does not
    claim. You cannot declare a requirement irrelevant to a business you are in.
  - A subject must pin a version or commit. "LangChain does not do X" is false
    within a month of being written unless it says which LangChain.

The point of putting these in code rather than in a style guide is that the
census cannot be published with an assessment that breaks them. The check runs
in CI like everything else.
