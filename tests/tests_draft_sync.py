"""The Internet-Draft says what the validator does. Run: python3 tests_draft_sync.py

There are now two normative statements of this format: scripts/testimony_validate.py,
which decides what passes, and spec/draft-clifford-testimony-record-00.md, which is
what the IETF and anyone implementing from paper will read. A specification that
disagrees with its own reference implementation is worse than no specification,
because the disagreement is invisible until somebody has already built the wrong
thing and been told their record is invalid.

The first draft of that document got three things wrong within an hour of being
written: it omitted `proposed_by` from decision, omitted `subject` and `proposition`
from conflict, and invented `held_from` and `held_until`, which exist nowhere. All
three were caught by reading the validator afterwards. This suite is that reading,
made automatic, so the fourth mistake is caught by CI rather than by a stranger who
implemented the draft and could not work out why.

What is checked is the machine-checkable overlap: entry types, required members,
enumerated values, and the untrusted identity sources. Prose is not checked and
cannot be. The point is that no field name, type name or allowed value can be added
to, removed from, or renamed in one file without the other failing.
