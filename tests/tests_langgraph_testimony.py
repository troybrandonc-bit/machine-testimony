"""The LangGraph adapter refuses what it cannot honestly record.

Run: python3 tests_langgraph_testimony.py

The adapter exists because LangGraph's resume boundary carries no identity: any
code holding the thread can answer an interrupt, and nothing on Command records
who did. An adapter that quietly filled that in would be worse than no adapter,
because the record would then assert something nobody checked.

So the interesting tests here are not the happy path. They are the four
refusals: an unclassified action, an identity the model could have written, an
agent approving itself, and a record written while an action is still pending.
Each one is a way to produce a plausible file that lies, and each raises.

The happy path is still checked, end to end, through the real validator, because
a record that refuses everything and validates as nothing is not useful either.
