"""The census refuses assessments that cannot be checked. Run: python3 tests_census.py

A census of other people's software is a document that can do real damage, and
the people in it did not ask to be. The defence is not care, because care is
not auditable. It is that the tooling will not accept an assessment somebody
else cannot go and check, and this suite is what says so out loud.

The rule that matters most is the one about absence. Saying a system does not
keep some fact, without saying where you looked, is an accusation with a
measurement's clothes on. Every other rule here is ordinary hygiene; that one
is the whole reason the census can be published at all.
